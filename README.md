I have chosen Next Js 14.1.0 as the frontend framework for our project and used Tailwind CSS to make up all the page's styles and components. The code language is Typescript & I have used the popular testing framework Jest to test the website using several cases. Further, I sourced some two to three components from Next UI.


## Design Approach ‚ö°Ô∏è

‚úÖ App router approach has been applied for our project with the sections of the landing page separated into different components.  
‚úÖ To favour maintainability and readability, I have extracted the content and models away from the components.  
‚úÖ The ``` src/common ``` folder contains all the types/models and data, which are imported as needed.  
‚úÖ Tailwind classes are followed systematically to give a coherent feel to the page. Screen-size modifiers ```lg | md``` are utilized for responsive adaptation to the screen size.  
‚úÖ ```src/static``` folder contains all the images & SVGs used in the project.  
‚úÖ As least as possible repetition has been targeted. 

## Testing üõ†Ô∏è

- A total of 23 Tests in 11 Test Suites have been written to comprehensively test the site using Jest 29.7.0.
- Tests cover the display checks of all the major contents & images in components, navbar and footer.
- Interactive elements like button scroll, input fields & responsive behaviour have also been tested.
- All the tests are in ```__tests__``` folder inside the root directory.

## Page Load Time ‚è∞

<a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1RMl-8kDCfEEXGopy8RVMzSq_c4EtU3f-"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1RMl-8kDCfEEXGopy8RVMzSq_c4EtU3f-" style="width: 500px; max-width: 100%; height: auto" title="speed tests using lighthouse" />

I measured the load times of the website using Google Lighthouse. The performance ratings were good and the content load time ranged between 0.3s to 0.8s for the desktop.

## Challenges Faced üèãÔ∏è

Overall, I enjoyed the task. I found the task to be easy but time-consuming. Still, these are some small hurdles I faced:-  
- Handling the little quirks of the UI & the differences between the desktop and mobile views.
- Writing meaningful tests to judge the site.

## Final Words üòä

Hope you would have liked my work and commitment. I would love to get the feedback and suggestions on my coding practices. Thank you.
