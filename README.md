I have chosen Next Js 14.1.0 as the frontend framework for our project and used Tailwind CSS to make up all the page's styles and components. I have used the popular testing framework Jest to test the website using several cases. Further, I sourced some two to three components from Next UI.


## Design Approach ⚡️

✅ App router approach has been applied for our project with the sections of the landing page separated into different components.  
✅ To favour maintainability and readability, I have extracted the content and models away from the components.  
✅ The ``` src/common ``` folder contains all the types/models and data, which are imported as needed.  
✅ Tailwind classes are followed systematically to give a coherent feel to the page. Screen-size modifiers ```lg | md``` are utilized for responsive adaptation to the screen size.  
✅ ```src/static``` folder contains all the images & SVGs used in the project.  
✅ As least as possible repetition has been targeted. 

## Testing 🛠️

- A total of 23 Tests in 11 Test Suites have been written to comprehensively test the site using Jest 29.7.0.
- Tests cover the display check of all the major contents & images in components, navbar and footer.
- Interactive elements like button scroll, input fields & responsive behaviour have also been tested.

## Page Load Time ⏰

I measured the load times of the website using Google Lighthouse. The performance ratings were good and the content load time ranged between 0.3s to 0.8s for the desktop.

## Challenges Faced 🏋️

Overall, I enjoyed the task. I found the task to be easy but time-consuming. Still, these are some small hurdles I faced:-  
- Handling the little quirks of the UI & the differences between the desktop and mobile views.
- Writing meaningful tests to judge the site.

## Final Words 😊

Hope you would have liked my work and commitment. I would love to get the feedback and suggestions on my coding practices. Thank you.
